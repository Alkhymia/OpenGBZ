# OpenGBZ
This is an **OpenSource Gameboy Zero PCB Project**. It is intended to make your own custom Button PCB and change the design to your wishes.
Your welcome to download the PCB files and use it for your own project. If you change anything on the design it would be great if you  
push your changes here so the project can grow and we can get some nice different designs and ideas.

Please also add your changes to the forum post so everybody can easily see the changes and features of the different designs. (forumpost found here: ----) I will also add the different designes here in the Readme file (CanÂ´t update all the time and immediately so in the forum should be the newest versions)

## How to add your Designe and what is needed:
In the different directories you find the different PCBs. If you want to push a design please add a new directory with a name for your designe and in there add a README.md where you can shortly describe the features of your PCB.
This readme should at least include (See OSDMG0v1 and OSDMG0v2 as a template) :
* **Your name** (and on which board its based of)
* If you tested the Board and if it works
* A description of the Features of the Board (also some Pictures would be nice)
* Additional Info to youse the Board if needed.

You can also add your current work in progress files and ask others for ideas or feedback. If so mark your post as work in progress.
